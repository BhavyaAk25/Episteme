# 🎬 Demo Script — 3 Minutes Exactly

## Pre-Roll (0:00 - 0:10)
**[Show the Episteme logo/title screen]**

*"Episteme turns plain-English requirements into verified database systems — not just diagrams. It builds, tests, and self-heals your schema, powered by Gemini 3."*

## Act 1: The Build (0:10 - 0:50)

**[Show the empty canvas with prompt input]**

*"Let's build an inventory management system for a sneaker brand."*

**[Type prompt, click Generate]**

*"Watch — Gemini 3 is generating the complete ontology and schema in real time."*

**[Build animation plays: tables appear, columns fill in, relationships draw, constraints snap]**

*"Each table, column, and relationship is being constructed live — this isn't a static diagram, it's a Palantir-inspired ontology with objects, links, and actions."*

**[Animation completes, fitView zooms to show full ERD]**

## Act 2: The Ontology (0:50 - 1:20)

**[Click on the Ontology sidebar]**

*"On the left, our semantic layer — object types like Warehouse and Product, with confidence scores from Gemini."*

**[Click an Action Type]**

*"Each action is a first-class operation — TransferStock has preconditions, a transaction plan, and audit logging."*

**[Click a table node on canvas]**

*"The inspector shows every column, constraint, and index — with Gemini's reasoning for each design decision."*

## Act 3: The Break (1:20 - 1:50)

**[Click Simulate]**

*"Now let's stress-test it. Episteme runs chaos tests — duplicate SKUs, negative inventory, orphaned records."*

**[Simulation runs, bottom drawer fills with results]**

*"Three failures found. Negative stock allowed, duplicate SKU detected, orphan line item."*

**[Click on 'Negative Stock Error' incident]**

*"The TransferStock action has a concurrency bug — inventory can drop below zero."*

## Act 4: The Fix (1:50 - 2:25)

**[Click Auto-Fix]**

*"Gemini 3 diagnoses the root cause and generates a migration patch."*

**[Show the diff: ALTER TABLE inventory ADD CONSTRAINT CHECK (quantity >= 0)]**

*"One ALTER TABLE statement. The patch is applied in our sandbox, tests rerun..."*

**[Tests rerun, all green]**

*"...and everything passes. The schema healed itself."*

## Act 5: The Export (2:25 - 2:45)

**[Click Export]**

*"One click exports production-ready artifacts — SQL migrations, the full ontology as JSON, and a verification report proving everything was tested."*

**[Show the verification report briefly]**

*"50,000 seed records, 732 chaos scenarios, 5 issues auto-resolved."*

## Closing (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Zoom out to show full app]**

*"Episteme — Gemini 3 isn't just generating a schema. It's architecting, testing, and proving a system. Built with Gemini 3 Flash structured outputs, streaming, and multi-step function calling."*

**[Show URL]**

*"Try it yourself at [URL]. Thank you."*

## Demo Recording Tips

1. **Pre-load the prompt** — have it typed and ready, just click Generate
2. **Set playback speed to 1x** for the build animation — fast enough to be impressive, slow enough to see
3. **Practice the script 3 times** before recording
4. **Use a screen recorder** at 1080p — OBS (free), QuickTime (Mac), or Loom
5. **Record audio separately** if your mic is noisy, then sync
6. **Keep the browser window clean** — no bookmarks bar, no other tabs
7. **Total time: 2:50 - 3:00** — leave a 10-second buffer, judges may not watch past 3:00
